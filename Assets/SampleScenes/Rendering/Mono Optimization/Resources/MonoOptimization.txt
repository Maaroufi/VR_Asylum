This scene demonstrates a method to optimize stereo rendering by rendering distant parts of the scene in mono (only once).

The near parts of the scene are rendered in stereo over the top. By displaying the mono images at the correct stereo disparity, the join between the two is seamless.

This can improve performance both because it reduces the number of draw calls (half the number in the mono region), and also the pixel fill requirements.
